\title{maskData obfuscates a column vector}
\usage{
maskData(x, header = "", randomize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{column vector of data to mask}

\item{header}{character string to preappend to each value}

\item{randomize}{should the mask be applied randomly?}
}
\value{
a named character vector
}
\description{
maskData maps the current values in a column (such as names) and maps them to
either 1 or 2 levels. This is useful for quickly changing surgeon names in a
report so that the surgeon identity is protected. The original values are set
to the names of the newly created character vector. When there are less than
26^4 values then LETTERS are used but otherwise a numeric index is applied.
